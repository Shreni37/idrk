- FFC: Can you take me to the other side?
- Hooded man: Yes sure.

- Hooded man: **Bâ‚¬ware of the man with the graven image of a TETO pear**
- Hooded mam: The man who can be a dog, a feline, a girl, a maid, and an shapeshifter at the same time.
- Hooded man: **Beware of the man who has a secret connection with Adion and Dabaizah.**
